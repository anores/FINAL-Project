Every time you run in to unexpected behavior in your project (a bug, a component that works differently than you thought, or something else), make an entry in your log. Describe the following:

1. In a sentence, explain the behavior you expected.
2. In a sentence, explain the observed behavior.
3. Formulate a hypothesis about what might be causing the mismatch: what part of your code or what part of your circuit is behaving in a way you don't expect?
4. Test your hypothesis: what action can you take you determine if your hypothesis is true?
5. What is the result of your test?
6. Repeat steps iii-v above until you resolve your "bug".

LOG: 

-Come up with idea for project - 3D printed planters that detect moisture level & give feedback through 3 different LED light 
colors.  Colors are intractive through motion detection.
-go to hybrid lab to talk about my idea, and what components/software I might need.
