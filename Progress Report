1. What you've done so far.
So far I have built the code to determine when the moisture detector will give feedback through three different LED colors
depending on the amount of moisture on the soil.  I have 3D printed one of the planters, but just for testing.

2. What remains to be done.
I have yet to test out the code on actual soil with two plants, one that's drying and one that has sufficient water, which
I plan on getting tomorrow (Sunday).  I need to start building the code for motion detection to trigger the LED on
the planter to light up when someone approaches.  I also need to print the actuall planter and integrate both sensors to 
with it.

3. A schedule for completing the work.
Sunday, Monday - Get plants, work on code for motion detector, get feedback from you.
Tuesday - Meet with coach for feedback on code, test code on plants/soil. 
Wednesday - Get feedback from you, meet with coach for feedback on code, test code on plants/soil, 
Wednesday-Saturday - 3D planter, integrate sesnors with it.
Saturday-Sunday - Work on final presentation.
